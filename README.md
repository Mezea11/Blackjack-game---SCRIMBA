This is a Blackjack game that's built using Javascript and HTML/CSS. This simple project uses DOM manipulation to render the game logic and a basic HTML/CSS layout that the player can interact with.

Currently it features two functions: Start game and Draw new card.

In its current state, the player has the option to start the game, which automatically draws two cards. The player then has the option to draw a new card in order to get Blackjack (21 points).
Depending on the numbers that the player gets, it triggers different conditionals that either lets you win, draw a new card or lose. 

This is a work in progress and meant to be a solo project with the goal of further practicing basic JS syntax.
